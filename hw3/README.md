# Data Mining Homework 3


## Problem 1

Under the `p1/` folder can be found a jupyter notebook providing the code and
the analysis of the kijiji clustering. Although an `html` version of the
notebook is provided for better accessibility, it is strongly encouraged to use
the jupyter server since some parts of the notebook are interactive.

## Problem 2

Under the `p2/` folder can be found a pdf containing the report of Problem 2.
