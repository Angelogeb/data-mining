# Data Mining Homework 2

# Report

The report can be found in `report.html`. It uses MathJax from a CDN therefore
in case of missing network connection the formulas will be unreadable.

# Problem 1

The program requires flask as a dependency otherwise just run the
`index.py` file.

```
$ cd p1
$ ./server.py
```

# Problem 2

See usage section and examples in report.html

# Problem 3

```
$ cd p3
$ ./spark_lsh.py
```

# Notes

Problem 2 and 3 require the mmh3 package although they provide a plain python
implementation
